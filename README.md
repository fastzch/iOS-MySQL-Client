iOS MySQL Client
================

Simple Obj C wrapper for using mysql database on iOS platform.

In the sample project you can found mysql_connector compiled for ios platform and Obj C Wrapper for this.
Also there's example controller and example table classes for db connection and simple working with tables.

Unfortunately not working under Xcode 6. Will be fixed in the near future.
